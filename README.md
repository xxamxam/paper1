# Balancing Efficiency and Interpretability

## A New Approach to Multi-Objective Optimization with High Computation Costs in Lipschitz Functions

### Installation

To run, you need to download all the files and install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   git clone 
   ...
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

For convenience, it is recommended to use the conda interpreter.

The main experiments and the preparation of data for them are shown in stages in the corresponding ipynb files. The data for the `mcf` experiment has been uploaded to the repository in the `datasets/germany 50' folder due to their smallness.
